<p>This is a fun day, because today: we get to break stuff. I&rsquo;ve noticed the similarity between mythology and corporate America. No, not the part where we believe in fantasy shit (like the fact that we don&rsquo;t know our per-unit cost but claim to be able to forecest next quarter&rsquo;s profit margin), but how we idolize people and practices. We sit around the campfire (a.k.a. meetings) and regale in the bard&rsquo;s tale of an epic hero and his journey. Some might call it corporate culture. Maybe that is the right word, I don&rsquo;t know- but let&rsquo;s look at the side-effects of regailing in this epic tale.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;accolade.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/accolade.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>The hero of our story is named Larry. Why Larry? Because this is real life, and not everyone gets a bad ass name like &ldquo;Onswot the dragon slayer&rdquo; or &ldquo;Frauhausen the Destroyer&rdquo;. Larry is the first one in the office. He&rsquo;s the last one to leave. He never takes vacation, and every time a critical system breaks: Larry is the only one who can save the fucking day. If Larry gets hit by a bus&hellip; Who knows? We all know a Larry. There is a strong possibility you might be a Larry yourself. Let&rsquo;s give our story a little twist though (after all, what good is a hero&rsquo;s tale without a twist?). Let&rsquo;s view this story through the doe-eyed perception of our young intern.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;12819769039355.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/12819769039355.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Our intern wants to be a part of this tribe, and wants to show to the tribal elders that he or she is worthy of battle, and worthy of wearing the tribe&rsquo;s crest. But how?<br />
Sorry to dishearten anyone looking for a happy ending, because you&rsquo;ll not find one here. The path for the intern has been blazed by the hero, and his story is retold around the campfire repeatedly. If the intern is to prove his&#47;her salt with this tribe- they must become the subject of campfire stories themselves. So they show up early, work through lunch, send emails at 3am, and strive to be the last out the door every night. But it&rsquo;s not enough! No one calls their name out in vain when systems break! No one desperately searches for their home phone number in the middle of the night. Our intern struggles&hellip; how to achieve this level of heraldry?!?! The answer lies in the hero&rsquo;s story itself: the intern must build single points of failure, document nothing, and share no knowledge to ensure that it is their name, and their name alone that echoes the hallways!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;4599_LG.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/4599_LG.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>But how has this helped our tribe to prosper and grow? I&rsquo;m afraid it hasn&rsquo;t, and worse off: we perpetuated our own fate. And this, dear reader is where we pick up the statues of our heroes and cast them to the ground so that they shatter into thousands of pieces. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: this is not a blog post against Larry. Our hero did what he could, with what he had available. But, I&rsquo;m sure if we asked our hero directly, rather than being the hero- he&rsquo;d probably rather be at home watching Family Guy.<br />
Weaving a different tale: Now with our statues shattered on the floor, we must rebuild our culture, not forsaking where we came from, but clearly identifying who will get us where we&rsquo;re going. How do we recognize the characteristics of these individuals? For starters, look to see who the last one to work is. No, not the person 5 minutes late. 30 minutes late? Nope. How about the guy who shows up just before lunch.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;spicoli_ready.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spicoli_ready.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>WHAT? Am I even to be taken seriously at this point?<br />
Quite possibly.<br />
When does this individual go to lunch? Shortly after arriving to work? Good. He (she) is still a candidate.<br />
It&rsquo;s 5 o&rsquo;clock now. Has this person been gone for hours? Yes? Oh boy, this is getting promising! Now for the final test...</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;sshot4e9d0b8560573.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sshot4e9d0b8560573.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>The systems that this person is responsible for: do they ever go down? Rarely? When they do, is it well-documented, with a small army of people who either know how, or can quickly learn to recover them without so much as a blink of an eye? If all of this is true, then you have found the individual who produces the desired output of the company with the least amount of time and effort possible. This should be the goal. Not hours per week worked, but value per week delivered.<br />
Save the hero shit for when your telling your kids about what you do at work. Added bonus: follow this plan and you&rsquo;ll actually have the time to do so.</p>
