<p>If there are awards for the most creative title, I won&rsquo;t be winning one as the title was stolen directly from Techzing at the article by the same&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;techzinglive.com&#47;page&#47;443&#47;techzing-70-%E2%80%93-derek-sivers-the-sivers-effect" title="" target="_blank">name<&#47;a>! I have not been my usual, jump up and go kick some ass self lately and decided to investigate and find out why. Turns out, I already had this podcast open in a browser tab so I started listening.<br>With just a few minutes, I was already starting to feel better and understand where my zing had gone.<br>The whole point here is that it&rsquo;s incredibly important to your mental sanity to pour in fresh ideas from people smarter than yourself. On occassions when you can&rsquo;t hang out with those people in person- podcasts are the next best thing, right? Derek is a great source of inspiration. His background is similar to many of us in the tech industry, with passions for music, writing code and launching startups.<br>Highlights:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>Derek&rsquo;s story: he&rsquo;s suprisingly down to earth, with many of the same goals and objectives I have<&#47;li>
<li>It really is about creating something, not outsourcing said creation<&#47;li>
<li>Write. It&rsquo;s an outlet (often for more than one reason)<&#47;li></p>
<li>The standard pace is for chumps<&#47;li><&#47;ul>
<p>One of the important things I realized (again) today is that you have to have worthy goals- things that interest and drive you. Sometimes you pick goals and they fizzle out and lose that exciting quality. When that happens, no big deal. Acknowledge. Move on. Set another goal.<br>That&rsquo;s all.<br>No, seriously- that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;<&#47;p>
