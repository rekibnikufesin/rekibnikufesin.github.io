<div>Nothing.<&#47;div></p>
<div>I click the start button again.<&#47;div></p>
<div>Still nothing.<&#47;div></p>
<div>Looks like I&rsquo;m driving the car to work again.<&#47;div></p>
<div>That was two months ago. Guess what? My bike is still broken. I really want to fix it. I enjoy doing the work, I love the freedom and zen-like experience of riding it to work, but it keeps losing priority against other tasks.<&#47;div></p>
<div>In effect, my 2008 Buell 1125R is technical debt.<&#47;div></p>
<div>It&rsquo;s the old server at the bottom of the rack with the noisy hard drives. It&rsquo;s the WordPress updates that should be installed, but you need to verify your backup first. It&rsquo;s the security updates for the finance servers. It&rsquo;s the breaking changes in the dependencies for those npm modules. It&rsquo;s anything that needs to be done but isn&rsquo;t stopping production at the moment.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>You will never eliminate technical debt, but ignoring it completely is not the right answer. What follows are some of the best examples I&rsquo;ve found in my career for managing technical debt. Read on, apply, comment with your suggestions.<&#47;div></p>
<div><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;11&#47;dad_jokes_-_Google_Search.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4346" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/dad_jokes_-_Google_Search-300x228.png" alt="dad clothes" width="300" height="228" &#47;><&#47;a>1. Spring Cleaning: Remember those days when you were a kid, waking up and stumbling down the hallway- ready for a big bowl of cereal and some Saturday morning cartoons? But then you saw your parents: dressed in their &ldquo;work clothes&rdquo;.<&#47;div></p>
<div>They were cheerful.<&#47;div></p>
<div>Sarcastically cheerful.<&#47;div></p>
<div>That big grin on their faces.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>Uh-oh.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>No good can come from this.<&#47;div></p>
<div>That&rsquo;s when they would gleefully announce &ldquo;it&rsquo;s spring cleaning day!&rdquo; and you would sacrifice an entire Saturday to cleaning stuff out of the garage. At times, you wondered where this stuff came from. Were the neighbors dropping their used stuff in your garage? Seriously.<&#47;div></p>
<div>Apply the same concept to your team. Have a spring cleaning day. Most of our stuff is virtualized these days anyway, so add some excitement to it. Have your team meet on a Saturday morning at a coffee shop. Everyone has to dress in their &ldquo;gotta clean the garage clothes&rdquo; and you spring for the coffee and donuts. Have some fun with it, crank up the tunes and laugh about the things you find. Parade that cron job that deletes &#47;tmp every hour around for everyone to laugh at. Make sure there isn&rsquo;t blame, we&rsquo;ve all done stuff we&rsquo;re not proud of but had to do it to keep the wheels of progress rolling. Laugh about it, fix it, have another cup of Kona.<&#47;div></p>

<div><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;11&#47;vocational_-_Google_Search.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4347 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/vocational_-_Google_Search-300x176.png" alt="vocational" width="300" height="176" &#47;><&#47;a>2. Vocational days: Make a list of things that need to be resolved. Assign them to your junior team members. Not staffed for that? How about opening the opportunity up to some co-workers outside of your department? Like the intern in marketing? He doesn&rsquo;t work on your team, but thanks to his courses in school is well-versed in the basic skills needed to lend a helping hand and the experience will serve him well in the future as he gains a deeper understanding of how all the systems interconnect. Let him stare at them awkwardly until he understands them, then guide him to the solutions. It will take some extra effort, but the issues will get resolved. Your team members will get some valuable experience as a bonus.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;11&#47;push_the_button_-_Google_Search.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4348" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/push_the_button_-_Google_Search-300x208.png" alt="Push the button" width="300" height="208" &#47;><&#47;a>3. Outsource: Hire a consultant or firm that specializes in the areas you need help. Define a list of tasks and desired outcome. Be specific in the deliverables, not the steps. Not everyone solves a problem the same way, so make sure the results are clearly defined. Your goal here is to eliminate the technical debt, not micro-manage the steps in between. Let go of control and gain the results.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>Step 3 is what I had to do with the Buell. I really wanted to work on it myself. I love getting my hands dirty and was looking forward to tearing into it to see what was going on, but it didn&rsquo;t happen. At the same time, I wanted to involve my kids as well, to teach them some fundamental mechanical skills. Again, it wasn&rsquo;t happening- too many other things kept getting in the way. Ultimately, I found a great mechanic with experience working on Buells. A side-bonus: he only lived a short distance away. He arrived at my house 15 minutes after talking to him and I felt a huge relief as he drove away with my bike on his trailer. I would be riding again soon, and while he was working on the bike- I could continue working on other, higher priority tasks. I&rsquo;ve heard the expression &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use all of the brains I have, and all the brains I can borrow&rdquo; and I believe this is what it means. Let go of the control, and focus on the results.<&#47;div></p>
