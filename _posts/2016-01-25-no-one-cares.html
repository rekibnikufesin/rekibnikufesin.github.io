<p class="p1"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4359" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/living_under_a_rock_-_Google_Search-300x223.png" alt="living under a rock" width="300" height="223" />TL;DR - a 90 second video that sums up this post:&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/23oUqbg">http://bit.ly/23oUqbg</a></p></p>
<p class="p1">Without resorting to references about living under a rock or being from the stone age, it&rsquo;s a fair assumption that you&rsquo;re familiar with Amazon&rsquo;s AWS API Gateway and Lambda. Maybe you&rsquo;ve even logged in and checked it out. At that point though, if you didn&rsquo;t dedicate some serious book-learnin' time to it, you probably hit the same high learning curve that has stopped many from pursuing it further.</p></p>
<p class="p1">No shit. It&rsquo;s a seriously steep learning curve. Especially if you weren&rsquo;t already familiar with the AWS Console. So that raises the question: why bother? You&rsquo;ve already got some means of deploying your API servers and have enough &ldquo;new stuff&rdquo; to learn as it is (especially if you&rsquo;re coding in JavaScript!). Let&rsquo;s look at what we <b>don&rsquo;t</b> have to do when you deploy using the API Gateway and Lambda.</p></p>
<p class="p1">Patching: everyone who loves reading Release Notes, verifying dependencies and validating compatibility across versions raise your hand! Hmmm. Not a big fan, huh? Yeah, me neither.</p></p>
<p class="p1">Maintenance: Routine maintenance windows with scheduled downtime or rolling updates? Yes please, I&rsquo;d love <b>0</b> more of those!</p></p>
<p class="p1">Hardware: BOOM! I love getting failed disk alerts at 2am and rolling my nocturnal ass down to a data center to change out a hard drive! Not.</p></p>
<p class="p1">Clustering, load balancing, deployment integration, continuous deployment: all great, worthy stuff and a necessity to online business today, but if I can get out of that work???</p></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4360" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Will_Button_on_Twitter___AWS_API_Gateway_and_Lambda__Who_cares___aws__apigateway__lambda__nodejs__javascript_https___t_co_B2IPJz3447_https___t_co_RZk9BLmkhi_-300x179.png" alt="sysadmins" width="300" height="179" />In my opinion, that&rsquo;s the real beauty of services like the API Gateway and Lambda. Your application is launched automatically on a fully patched, fault tolerant, scalable instance and no effort is required on your part to make that happen. Well, no effort aside from learning how to use the tool. That&rsquo;s a fair trade. The biggest benefit of all though is that you spend more time writing the code that delivers value to your customers. Sure, all of the things I listed above are of value to your customer, but it&rsquo;s not the value they want to pay you for. They want to pay you for the application logic that enables them to do that thing they do, that&rsquo;s why your their guy or girl, not because you have a stack of spare hard drives next to your night stand.</p></p>
<p class="p1">So yeah, I totally agree the learning curve is steep. But with a little effort on your part, it turns into faster delivery and potentially better service for your customers. When you&rsquo;re ready to take on that challenge, I&rsquo;ve spent a ton of time on this subject and have a couple of resources for you. If you love right-to-the-point crash course info, I&rsquo;ve created some lessons on <a href="http://egghead.io">egghead.io</a>. You can check them out here: <a href="https://bit.ly/EggheadAWS">http://bit.ly/EggheadAWS</a>. If on the other hand, you like to go deep and understand what happens beneath the shiny chrome I&rsquo;ve got an in-depth lesson on the AWS API Gateway on Pluralsight at <a href="http://bit.ly/1RK8iIW">http://bit.ly/1RK8iIW</a>.</p></p>
