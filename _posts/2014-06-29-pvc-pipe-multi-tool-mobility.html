<p>Earlier this month, Donn Felker wrote <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.donnfelker.com&#47;your-desk-job-is-killing-you-and-your-posture-sucks&#47;" target="_blank">this<&#47;a> excellent post on taking care of your back. It got me thinking about other ways to take care of your upper body&nbsp;as well. As a CrossFit L1 coach, I spend the mornings working with people struggling to improve mobility. As a Site Reliability Engineer, I spend the rest of my day understanding how my athletes got in that position!</p>
<p>I keep two things beside my desk: a piece of PVC pipe, and a foam roller. Donn already covered the use of the foam roller in his article, so I'll focus on how to use the PVC pipe in this one. <em>(While I'm at it- I'd like to challenge every gym in the country to issue a 5' PVC pipe to every new client that joins their gym. You could even go as far as offering a discount on membership if they tweet&#47;post&#47;pin&#47;whatever a selfie using the PVC while at work and mention your gym!)<&#47;em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Let's start with the basics: what the hell am I talking about?<&#47;h2><br />

<h2><strong>PVC Pipe?&nbsp;<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
Yeah, PVC pipe. You know- the white pieces of pipe they sell at home improvement stores. If you've never used one, go to your local hardware or home improvement store and purchase a 10' piece of 1&#47;2" PVC pipe. Get the white pipe, not the grey- you don't need the heavy-duty stuff for this. Now- take it home and cut it in half: BOOM-- I just gave you two 5' portable flexibility rods for the price of one!&nbsp;<em>(Another tip: if you don't have a saw at home to cut it, wander through the 'Tools' section on your way to the checkout register and cut it there. If anyone asks, tell them you're researching purchasing a saw, cut the pipe, then put the saw down and walk away while mumbling "That's just not the one...")<&#47;em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-93 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/serious-223x300.jpeg" alt="I'm serious" width="223" height="300" &#47;>Now that you've got your pipe, what to do with it? For starters-- Star Wars. You know you want to, so just do it and get it out of your system-- swing it through the air making the&nbsp;<em>ZWHOOSH ZWSHOOOOOSSHHH<&#47;em>&nbsp;sounds. If you've got a buddy, give him&#47;her the other piece and battle it out. OK- on to the serious stuff:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're going to cover three different stretches that can be done with the PVC pipe. Each one will help to increase shoulder mobility by opening the shoulder joints and back from a different angle, which ultimately leads to more strength gains, less chance of injury, and reduced pain and inflammation in the joint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Pass-throughs<&#47;strong><&#47;h2><br />
To complete a pass-through, perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wrap your fingers around the bar as if it were a barbell at the ends of the pipe.<&#47;li>
<li>Your arms should be fairly wide.<&#47;li>
<li>Tighten your core.<&#47;li>
<li>Now tighten your core tighter- this means squeeze your abs and butt cheeks tight (many people fail to do this step and hold it, which results in the spine flexing to accomodate the motion instead of the shoulder joints)<&#47;li>
<li>Raise your arms over your head, and continue down behind you.<&#47;li>
<li>Reverse, raising your arms back up and lowering them in front of you, returning to the starting position.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
Your goal with this move is to move your hands as close as possible, while keeping your elbows locked out. If you find your elbows bending to complete the repetition, move your hands into a wider grip on the bar. Don't rush the movement- it should take approximately 3 seconds for one complete rep. Repeat 10 times or for approximately 30 seconds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Aeroplanes<img class="alignleft wp-image-95 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/CircleJerks-24x300.png" alt="circle jerks" width="24" height="300" &#47;><&#47;h2><br />
I'm sure there is another name for it, I just don't know what it is. If I were to guess, I'd say "circle jerk", but that probably only reinforces the fact that I shouldn't guess. For this exercise, you're going to keep the same grip on the bar, and you're going to keep your core tight-- but you're going to move each arm in a vertical circle in the sagittal plane. Makes perfect sense, right? Maybe not-- so let me elaborate further:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the same grip on the bar as the pass-through, push one arm forward while pulling the other back.<&#47;li>
<li>Once the arm going forward has reaches full extension, drop it down and behind you-- then back up, making a complete circle.<&#47;li>
<li>Repeat with the other arm.<&#47;li>
<li>The end result is something similar to a highly exaggerated rowing motion, as if in a canoe with a double-sided paddle. Just like the pass-throughs above, you want to go nice and slow with these, feeling the stretch all the way through. At the same time, note any areas that are tighter or feel weaker than the rest of the motion. Use the information to know your bodies reaction and response to different weighted movements. For instance, if you see that your left shoulder has significantly limited range at the top and today's WOD includes Overhead Squats-- you should consider scaling the weight appropriately for your left arm, rather than trying to force it to keep up with the right. Otherwise, it will fail; you will get injured; then we'll have the conversation about why your doctor is putting you on light duty and recommending that you quit CrossFit because it's dangerous. (and hopefully-- a really, really,&nbsp;<em> really<&#47;em> bright light bulb just went off above your head!)<&#47;li><br />

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;two4seven.me&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;06&#47;lilwayne.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-96" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/lilwayne-150x150.jpg" alt="lil wayne" width="150" height="150" &#47;><&#47;a>is another stretch that I have no name for. But if it did- I'm sure it would be named&nbsp;<em>The Lil Wayne<&#47;em> or perhaps&nbsp;<em>The P Diddy,&nbsp;<&#47;em>because that's the face you will be making when you hit that "sweet spot" in the middle of your back!</p>
<p>For this one, you are going to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put your back against the wall<&#47;li>
<li>Place the PVC pipe horizontally between you and the wall, at your lower back<&#47;li>
<li>Keeping your back against the wall, perform an air squat-- allowing the PVC to roll up your back<&#47;li>
<li>If you're like most athletes, when the PVC rolls up to the lower part of your shoulder blades-- that's when the magic happens (and the matching facial expression!)<&#47;li>
<li>Feel free to adjust the starting point of the PVC or the squat to work on different areas of your back.<&#47;li>
<li>Like the other two exercises: nice and slow, 10 reps.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these exercises can be done in less than 5 minutes. I recommend keeping a piece of PVC at your desk or work area and trying to run through the exercises at least twice per day. If you put a little effort into it, you'll find that you can easily work these into otherwise "idle" parts of your day- such as while waiting on hold, during a phone conference, scheduled break times, or just a 5 minute stretch-break each hour (set a timer for a reminder). In addition to helping your mobility and performance at the gym, you'll find these short breaks re-energize you and help you focus better when you return to your desk and resume working.</p>
