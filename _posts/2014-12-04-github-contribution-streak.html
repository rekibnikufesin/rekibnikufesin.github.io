<p>Following the advice of many of my mentors, I've been trying to keep my github contribution streak alive. If you aren't familiar with the practice, it's a method to keep you focused and making daily progress on your important projects. The theory is this: make a commit to one of your repos daily.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>It's harder than it sounds somedays, but the rewards are many: First, you are making daily progress, no matter how small. Second- even if you feel the commit was small or insignificant, it keeps the brain juices flowing, stimulating critical thinking skills to solving your problems, even when you aren't thinking about them. Lastly, it shows commitment, endurance, and dedication.</p>
<p>It didn't take long my first time to fail. After speaking with a friend about it, I told him "somedays I just didn't feel my work was worthy of a 'commit', it would have been a bullshit commit, for the sake of committing." His response was "so what, it's still a commit, it still took your time and effort, and it still got your brain working on the problems that you have identified as important to you." It made good sense, so I took up the practice again. After a few weeks, I checked back in, only to see my current streak was 2 days!</p>
<p>WTF?!!?!!?</p>
<p>I had committed daily, without fail, and was reaping all of the benefits: my project was progressing faster than I'd hoped, I was solving problems that had plagued me for weeks, I was looking forward to working on it each night. I had everything except that stupid little number on my profile page. Why???? As it turns out, there are&nbsp;<em>rules<&#47;em> regarding what counts as a commit. :( I did some research and found the github doc explaining it all <a href="https:&#47;&#47;help.github.com&#47;articles&#47;why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile&#47;" target="_blank">here<&#47;a>. The one rule that was killing me day after day was that only commits to the master branch count, and I had been committing to a branch, writing code in preparation for the next release.</p>
<p>Going forward, I'll be using some of the tricks outlined in the docs to keep the number alive, things like opening an issue (it counts) to document what I want to work on the next day, updating the readme with dependencies and documentation, and updating lesser repos (like my vim settings) as well as moving my cheat sheets from Evernote into github.</p>

<p>I hope some of these tips are useful for you as well, and to my mentors: I know that each of us is the average of the 5 people we hang around with most, and I know I'm the guy bringing the average down. Thanks for letting me tag along! :)</p>
