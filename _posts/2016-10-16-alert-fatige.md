_phone rings_

`Hello?`

`Hello, is this Will Button?`

`Yes...`

`Hi Mr. Button, this is {insert name} from GoDaddy. We're calling to let you know that the hosting for one of your sites is about to expire.`

`Oh, that's great, I appreciate the call. I'm actually the technical contact for quite a few sites hosted with you. Can you let me know which one so I can best help you?`

`No sir, I'm afraid I can't do that...`

And with the greatest of compassion, desire, and effort to help me, the GoDaddy support rep and I play a few rounds of "Guess the password" or "Guess the account ID". Much like my attempts at gambling though, I never win.

This has been going on for years, to the point where I have GoDaddy's number saved in my phone and I don't even answer when I see them calling.
_DISCLAIMER:_
I'm not a bad guy. Many of the companies I've worked for in the past were early stage startups that aren't around anymore, so even in the event that I could guess the right credentials, the result would've been the same: there is no one home anymore.

So what does that have to do with alert fatigue?
It's really the same. You get the same message over and over until you subconsciously tune it out. Over time, you learn to ignore it, even when it's a legitimate alert. Which is exactly what happened.
Any guess as to which account id/password combination I never tried?

**How about my own personal account?!?!?**
You know, the one that used to host this former Wordpress site?
Yeah, that one. Which is how we got here, gentle reader.

On Friday, my website went down.
On Monday, I figured it out.
I'm sure I could call the fine folks at GoDaddy and they would happily restore my service. Despite the bad rap that they get, I can honestly say I never had an issue with their service. For a while now, I've been wanting to switch to using Jekyll and Github pages but never found the time to make the transition. Wordpress is nice, and certainly powerful but seemed like overkill for my use. Not to mention I _dreaded_ having to log in to the interface to add a new post.

Fortunately, I had a backup of the site from not _too_ long ago. With the help of a Wordpress to Jekyll plugin, and a bit of tweaking, here we are back online.
Forgive the broken URLs and some wonky text here and there, but for the most part- pretty happy with the switch.

Here's to hoping that I enjoy using Jekyll with much more frequency than my former Wordpress site!
