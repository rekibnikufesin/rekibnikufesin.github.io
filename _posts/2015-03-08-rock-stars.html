<p>There is a lot of hype and media surrounding new technology these days. You can&rsquo;t read a tech site without hearing about someone who&rsquo;s using product &ldquo;X&rdquo; and claims their life couldn&rsquo;t be better. <i>&ldquo;We scaled to millions of users on a t2.micro!&rdquo; &ldquo;It runs java, it runs javascript, it microwaves PIZZA during deployments!&rdquo;<&#47;i> &nbsp;Fuck. If Billy Mays were still alive, I feel like he&rsquo;d be pimping some of this shit. I don&rsquo;t doubt some of the stories are true, after all- I&rsquo;ve done my fair share of pushing software into production. Part of me though, has had enough of the &ldquo;Alpha version 0.0.0.1? TO PRODUCTION!&rdquo; mentality.<br />

<p>The weird thing is: you have to find a balance. Take today for instance- I spent the morning working on a server running Visual Basic 6 to debug a production app that has been running for over a decade. I wrapped up the night doing graceful rolling restarts of an elasticsearch cluster and watching it reallocate shards&hellip; even though I had disabled shard reallocation. Sigh.<br />
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong- I&rsquo;m not advocating Visual Basic 6, and I&rsquo;m not bashing Elasticsearch (at the moment, earlier today was a different story). The common theme to both of these problems, though decades apart in their lifecycle is lack of production expertise. Fuck VB6. Fuck ES. I&rsquo;m trying to run a fucking business here. My customers and clients don&rsquo;t give a shit what technology I&rsquo;m using but they do give a shit if I cost them a day due to downtime or can&rsquo;t deliver my goods when I promised.<br />
So where does the title &ldquo;Rock Stars&rdquo; come into play in this rant?<br />
Ace Frehley.<img class="aligncenter full" title="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ace-in-kiss.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;>You may not know him by name, but will probably recognize his face. He was the guitarist for the rock band KISS. He was quoted as saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not how you play guitar, it&rsquo;s how you <b>look <&#47;b>playing guitar.&rdquo; &nbsp;Where the hell is he now? I don&rsquo;t know, but I hope he&rsquo;s happy. The point is: he&rsquo;s no longer relevant to modern music. He did his thing, he cashed his check and he&rsquo;s living his dream.</p>
<p>Where are your rock star developers going to be 10 years from now? Will they be by your side busting their ass to help you meet payroll, or will they be headlining other gigs while your trying to find someone who can play their old tunes?</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a right or wrong answer.</p>
