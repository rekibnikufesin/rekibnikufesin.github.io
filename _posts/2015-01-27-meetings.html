<p>It could be just that I&rsquo;m getting old, but I&rsquo;m finding myself less tolerant of people wasting my time.<br><br><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;1422416577_full.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1422416577_thumb.jpeg" align="middle" class="aligncenter full" alt="" title=""><&#47;a><br><br>I use a number of strategies to get out of meetings, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s as simple as a &ldquo;Fuck off&rdquo;. No further explanation needed (see follow-up notes below). Other times, I think I can actually explain away my distaste for meetings logically. Feel free to adapt the following for your own use, and claim back part of your life.<br><br><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;1422417389_full.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1422417389_thumb.png" align="middle" class="aligncenter full" alt="" title=""><&#47;a><br><br>Consider this: at most tech startups, you can <b>very<&#47;b>&nbsp;conservatively estimate each employee is worth $100&#47;revenue. In an eight person meeting, lasting 1 hour- you just blew $800 of your startup&rsquo;s cash. Are you really in a position to do that?<br>Maybe so.<br>Would you spend $800 of your startups cash with getting a quote and turning in a receipt? I doubt it. So it&rsquo;s not really out of line for me to ask for a meeting agenda and follow up notes, is it? Aren&rsquo;t these the equivalent of a quote and receipt? If you can&rsquo;t produce those documents at the appropriate time, it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll see me at your meeting.<br><br>That strategy actually works quite well for formal meetings, but not so well for the guy or girl who just &ldquo;likes to grab a quick minute of your time&rdquo; but does so all too frequently.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;1422418002.gif" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1422418002.gif" align="middle" class="aligncenter full" alt="" title=""><br><&#47;a><br>I like to explain it like this: I get 24 hours each day. No more, no less. They are mine to do with as I choose, but I only get 24 of them. Now here you are, wanting to take one of them from me. I can make more coffee, I can make more money, I can make more witty jokes, but I cannot make more time so whatever you have to say to me should be so important that it is worth that same amount of time in my life that I will never get back.<br>Taylor Swift should write a song about this.<br>It may be selfish. Ok, it really is selfish, but it&rsquo;s true. My 24 hours on this earth each day is the only commodity I can&rsquo;t negotiate, so no- you are not entitled to any of it.<&#47;p></p>

Future, more elaborate explanations won&rsquo;t help. For these people, unless the individual in question has the authority to fire you on the spot, fall back to the standby #1: Fuck off.<br>It&rsquo;s your life, you&rsquo;re entitled to it.<&#47;p>
