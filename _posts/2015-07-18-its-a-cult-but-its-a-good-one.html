<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;haboob.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/haboob.jpg" alt="" align="left" &#47;><&#47;a>Unless you are a member of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.crossfithaboob.com" target="_blank">CrossFit Haboob<&#47;a>, you probably don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m have my CrossFit L1 certification. I haven&rsquo;t been there in a while, but I went back today to cheer on some friends from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.crossfitfourpeaks.com" target="_blank">CrossFit Four Peaks<&#47;a> in the 3rd annual Desert Dust Up Challenge. Though I went to be a spectator, there was no way I could let Ben and Sean down when they asked if I could help judge. They&rsquo;ve given so much to me there is no way I could ever repay them.</p>
<p>I ended up as a judge in the first heat for the athletes. Each athlete competed in a sequence of 3 twelve minute heats with 8 minutes between each. The event that I judged consisted of a 750m row, 100 wall balls, and as many pullups as you can manage within the 12 minute time cap. By design it&rsquo;s humbling, it levels the playing field, and it leaves every athlete of every caliber wondering how they are going to complete the next two events. As a result, I was asked by nearly every athlete: what do I do now?</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;the-best-feeling-is-doing-what-people-say-you-can-not-do-motivational-quotes.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/the-best-feeling-is-doing-what-people-say-you-can-not-do-motivational-quotes.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>So what can I say to someone in the 30 seconds I have before they have to leave an prepare for the next event?</p>
<p>Breathe.</p>
<p>Seriously. Almost every athlete I saw today could benefit from that piece of advise. I could see it on their face during the workout:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&rsquo;t breathe<&#47;li>
<li>It&rsquo;s too heavy<&#47;li>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to throw up<&#47;li>
<li>I&rsquo;m blacking out<&#47;li>
<li>It hurts<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
and the list goes on, but the theme was common: they were letting the voice in their head take control. Focusing on a simple breathing technique can eliminate all of this. Note that while I said the technique is simple, in practice it&rsquo;s quite difficult. The goal of breath control is to focus solely on watching the breath enter and leave your body. Emotionally it distracts your brain, preventing your conscious mind (or monkey mind) from chattering away with the thoughts listed above (that simply aren&rsquo;t true). Physically, it triggers a calming effect in the nervous system that allows you to override the fake physical symptoms you are feeling and achieve a higher level of performance.</p>

<p>So how do you do this &ldquo;breath control&rdquo; thing? It starts daily- just 5 minutes per day. That&rsquo;s all, no infomercial. No product to buy. No celebrity endorsement. Don&rsquo;t worry- you&rsquo;ll pay. Five minutes is a long, long time when you are trying to focus. Here we go: first lesson right fucking now. In a few seconds, you&rsquo;re going to click on the link below. It&rsquo;s a five minute timer and for the entire five minutes you are going to breathe in for a count of five, hold your breath for a count of five, exhale for a count of five, the maintain empty lungs for a count of five. It&rsquo;s a technique called &ldquo;box breathing&rdquo; that I learned from the website <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sealfit.com&#47;the-big-4-of-mental-toughness-part-2&#47;" target="_blank">www.sealfit.com<&#47;a>. A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>breathe into your belly- this is not the time to hold your &ldquo;six pack pose&rdquo;<&#47;li>
<li>if a 5 count is too long, use 4. Or 3. Just do it. Whatever it is, accept it and improve over time.<&#47;li>
<li>Your mind is going to wander. Everyone&rsquo;s does, so when you start thinking about laundry, bills, work, or the cute dude&#47;dudette down the block, gently bring your mind back to your breath.<&#47;li>
<li>Feel the air cross your nostrils, feel the life-giving force of the oxygen in your lungs. That&rsquo;s all.<&#47;li>
<li>It&rsquo;s ok to not be good, it&rsquo;s the practice that matters.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Ok, class is over- it&rsquo;s time to get it done. Click this link now. I&rsquo;ll see you in five minutes: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;e.ggtimer.com&#47;5minutes" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;e.ggtimer.com&#47;5minutes<&#47;a></p>

<p>How do you feel? Chances are, you struggled your first time. You probably peeked a couple of times thinking that the timer wasn&rsquo;t working. But there&rsquo;s also a good chance that those last 60 seconds you hit this sweet, zen-filled, what-the-hell-is-that zone. If not, that&rsquo;s cool too, we all start our journey some place different.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;05577302-33D6-4A5E-9156-37BB684BDF90.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/05577302-33D6-4A5E-9156-37BB684BDF90.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it. There are so many unbelievable benefits to every aspect of your life to doing this, and I&rsquo;m not going to go into them because you can find that out later. For now, just do this for 5 minutes per day. Oh, I know. You&rsquo;re busy. Hell, you spent 15 minutes just yesterday avoiding that aggravating co-worker who keeps trying to get you to go out for drinks and another 5 minutes being to polite to the telemarketer trying to pimp you out on some sweet, sweet re-financing. There&rsquo;s no way you can sneak down to your car for five minutes to do this. But if you are one of the brave, the few, the dedicated who can pull this off: strap on your helmet because your life is about to change. For the simple premise alone that next time you&rsquo;re grueling through a wod or a competition and your body starts to tell you lies, you&rsquo;ll be grounded. You&rsquo;ll say to yourself &ldquo;nah, I got this next breath. I got this. I fuckin rock.&rdquo;<br />
And. You. Do.</p>
