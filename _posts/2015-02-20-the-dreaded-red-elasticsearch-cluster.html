<p><img class="aligncenter full" title="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kick-in-the-groin.jpg" alt="" align="middle" &#47;>Few things in life make you want to kick yourself in the groin more than a red elasticsearch cluster. It&rsquo;s always the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>a node crashes<&#47;li>
<li>the cluster scrambles to reassign shards<&#47;li>
<li>you bring the node back online<&#47;li>
<li>the cluster scrambles to reassign shard<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Wait&hellip; what the hell? Why are those last few shards showing unassigned? &nbsp;<b><i>AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH<&#47;i><&#47;b>. Seriously. A kick in the groin would be painful, but you&rsquo;d know why, right?<br />
Unfortunately, this scenario is much more common in a new elasticsearch cluster before you have had a chance to learn the usage pattern and tune appropriately. Many times, from my experience, the issue is triggered by unexpected queries prior to getting the jvm tuned just right for your data, usage pattern, and frequency.<br />

<p>So here we are. What now?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to manually reassign those bitches.</p>
<p>Start by finding which shards are unassigned with<br />
curl&nbsp;http:&#47;&#47;localhost:9200&#47;_cat&#47;shards&nbsp;| grep UNASS<br />
This will return a list of unassigned shards in the format of "INDEX_NAME &nbsp; &nbsp; SHARD_NUMBER &nbsp; &nbsp;PRIMARY_OR_REPLICA &nbsp; &nbsp; NODE"<br />
For each shard listed, execute the following command:<br />
curl -XPOST -d '{ "commands" : [ { "allocate" : { "index" : "INDEX_NAME", "shard" : SHARD_NUMBER, "node": "PICK_A_NODE", "allow_primary": 1 } } ] }' http:&#47;&#47;localhost:9200&#47;_cluster&#47;reroute?pretty<br />
This will force the shard to reallocate. Once you make it through the list, your cluster should return to green.</p>
