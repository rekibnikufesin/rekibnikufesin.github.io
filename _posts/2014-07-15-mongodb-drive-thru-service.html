<h3>Announcing the MongoDB Drive-Thru Service!<&#47;h3><br />
For a limited time, I&rsquo;m offering my MongoDB Drive-Thru Service for both new and existing clients. The Drive-Thru Service is one-stop shopping to ensure your MMS Monitoring is setup correctly. The service covers the following checkpoints:&nbsp;<a id="more"></a><a id="more-104"></a></p>
<h3>MMS setup and monitoring of your MongoDB database environment<&#47;h3><br />
I&rsquo;ll ensure your entire MongoDB database environment is setup properly and reporting into the MMS service for accurate monitoring. All services will be verified, as well as ensuring the user accounts for your staff are created with appropriate permissions.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;07&#47;MMS_Setup.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-106 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/MMS_Setup-1024x190.png" alt="mms_setup" width="1024" height="190" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Multiple agent setup (where appropriate)<&#47;h3><br />
The MMS service reports on performance as seen from the agent. When network issues arise, this can lead to false alerts. &nbsp;For environments that support it, multiple agents will be setup to provide additional visibility into network vs. database performance issues.</p>

<h3>Custom dashboards<&#47;h3><br />
It&rsquo;s important that your entire staff is looking at, and referring to the same information. In the midst of an outage is the wrong time to learn that different team members are monitoring different alert points. Custom dashboards are built to show the most commonly measured metrics in MongoDB. Dashboards are then given environment-specific names, offering you reassurance that your team is now on a common ground for communication.</p>

<h2>1 hour training session<&#47;h2><br />
The best monitoring system in the world is useless if your staff is unfamiliar with it. During our 1 hour training session, we&rsquo;ll cover how your monitoring environment is setup as well as how to dig deeper for additional metrics and data.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;07&#47;MMS_training.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/MMS_training.jpg" alt="mms training" width="400" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<h3>Alerts so that your team is notified promptly<&#47;h3><br />
Key metrics are setup to alert the right team members at the appropriate interval, providing you with the best opportunity to intervene and react before the issue escalates. MMS offers many alerting options, I&rsquo;ll set your MMS up to monitor events appropriate to your unique environment.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;willbutton.co&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;07&#47;MMS_alerts.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-110" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/MMS_alerts-194x300.png" alt="mms alerts" width="194" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Setting up MMS can be the difference between proactive intervention and a complete outage for your company. Many <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mms.mongodb.com&#47;help&#47;tutorial&#47;configure-monitoring&#47;" target="_blank">resources exist<&#47;a>&nbsp;to help you set it up but in today&rsquo;s fast-paced development lifecycle, monitoring and alerting can either be overlooked, or mis-configured in an effort to focus on delivering customer-facing features. Using the Drive-Thru Service ensures that your MMS environment is setup following MongoDB&rsquo;s best practice recommendations, and at $699 is less than the cost of 1 hour of downtime for most organizations.</p>
